= Why Beans? =

Beans puts your customers first by creating a simple, fun and engaging experience. While for you we keep things simple: go through our quick set-up and after that everything is automated. The result is that Beans retailers get 5x more usage compared to traditional rewards systems.


= Beans Enterprise =
Beans is the chosen store credit system of many of Woocommerce’s largest retailers. Compared with traditional rewards programs Beans puts your customers in charge. This increases usage and diminishes support requests. We have the capability to provide high-volume retailers with both the necessary robust infrastructure and the support to launch their rewards program on Beans. You also have the option to build the exact rewards program you want with the Beans API.
